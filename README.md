# Osteoarthritis Prediction System

An AI-powered system that predicts the likelihood of Osteoarthritis (OA) from X-ray images using multiple deep learning models.  
The project is designed to help doctors and patients with early detection and decision-making by providing accurate predictions from multiple models.

---

## Features
- Upload X-ray images to predict Osteoarthritis likelihood.
- Provides a **percentage probability score** for OA.
- Utilizes **8 trained deep learning models**:
  - DINO, InceptionV3, CoAtNet, and EfficientNet (Original & Distributed versions).
- Shows results in a table with each modelâ€™s prediction (Original vs. Distributed) for easy comparison.

---

## Dataset
The dataset used is from Kaggle: [Osteoarthritis Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/farjanakabirsamanta/osteoarthritis-prediction)

We worked with **two versions of the dataset**:
1. **Original (OG)**  
   - Directly downloaded from Kaggle without modifications.
   - Models trained on this dataset reflect the natural class distribution.

2. **Distributed (dist)**  
   - All normal (non-OA) and OA-positive images were **merged and rebalanced** with a different Normal:OA ratio.
   - Separate models were trained on this dataset to address class imbalance and improve generalization.
